Saved R files (rds files), workflows, manuscripts of interest.

caddis_toy_meta.csv; subset of meta data from 12 samples, used as small dada2 tutorial for Catie Williams-REU.

caddis_meta.csv; file meta-data (sample names, sample types) for all 95 samples from April-2021 time sampling.

caddis-stripped-06262021.RDS; R session containing the final phyloseq object for n=95 samples from April-2021 time sampling. Created using dada2/phyloseq default settings.

dada2_to_phyloseq.md; commands used to process amplicon sequencing through dada2 (v1.16; latest as of May 2021). For the workflow, just used 12 samples
versus all (n=95) as this would take ~12 hours total to run through Desktop mac-osx.
Little to no deviation in commands from the defaults used in the dada2 tutorial (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html), just removed error plotting portions, read tracking steps.

exploratory.R; commands tony uses a lot but doesn't want to shifts through other stuff cuz he can't remember stuff.

manuscripts.txt; a collection of manuscript web-links of interest.

tutorial_unix.md; a brief overview/tutorial of unix (or unix-like) commands for working on an osx terminal. NOTE, line of the grey area can be directly copied and 
pasted into terminal, press enter, see the output. The output of this tutorial is from Tony's computer.

```
echo "hello world"
```
